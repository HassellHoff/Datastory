## Impact of Elon Musk quotes on Tesla's stock


### Abstract

Elon Musk is the world's richest person and is famous for gaining attention for his tweets that according to him half are generated while sitting on his toilet. During the recent years his tweets have gathered much attention by their impact on markets which has left investors worried. From jumping the value of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and dogecoin to small companies such as Gamestop Elon Musk's tweets have undeniably played a huge impact on moving stock prices of companies. 

It has been claimed that Elon Musk's twitter account could be Tesla's primary marketing tool since Tesla does not invest in marketing at all. The hypothesis of our analysis definately backs this theory. (Add something here)
